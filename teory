Machine Learning is a sort of branch of Artificial Intelligence.
Machine Learing is strictly correlated to A.I., but it is not the only method to solve A.I. problems.
Data Science is related to data, it is possible to use Machine Learning or other A.I. method to trasnform and use data.

Linear Regression is a prediction method to predict variables (Y) from a set of variables given (X).

Orecion and recall is used when I want to know how good is my statistic study.
Precision is the total fo True Positive / True Positive + False Positive.
Recall is the total fo True Positive / True Positive + False Negative.

Train set is the set where I train my dataset with a ML method.
After the train I need to validate my ML model, so I use a part my dataset to validate my ML model.
If my ML model in train and validate sets have done good predictions I go to test.
I take another dataset for test set (different form the 1st), and I use my ML model with these data to see if my ML model is working well.

The p-value is a value which is a condition to accept or not a certain data of a statistic test.
The p-value cannot be always reliable becuase it depends by the threshold value.
